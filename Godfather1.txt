				MICHAEL
		I told you I had a lot of relatives.
				MICHAEL
		They're waiting to see my father.
				MICHAEL
		They're going to talk to my father,
		which means they're going to ask
		him for something, which means they
		better get it right.
				MICHAEL
		Because they know that no Sicilian
		will refuse a request on his
		daughter's wedding day.
				MICHAEL
		No.  His name is Luca Brasi.  You
		wouldn't like him.
				MICHAEL
			  (Sizing her up)
		You really want to know?
				MICHAEL
		You like spaghetti?
				MICHAEL
		Then eat your spaghetti and I'll
		tell you a Luca Brasi story.
				MICHAEL
		Once upon a time, about fifteen
		years ago some people wanted to
		take over my father's olive oil
		business.  They had Al Capone send
		some men in from Chicago to kill my
		father, and they almost did.
				MICHAEL
		My Father sent Luca Brasi after
		them.  He tied the two Capone men
		hand and foot, and stuffed small
		bath towels into their mouths.
		Then he took an ax, and chopped one
		man's feet off...
				MICHAEL
		Then the legs at the knees...
				MICHAEL
		Then the thighs where they joined
		the torso.
				MICHAEL
		Then Luca turned to the other man...
				MICHAEL
		...who out of sheer terror had
		swallowed the bath towel in his
		mouth and suffocated.
				MICHAEL
		I told you you wouldn't like him.
				MICHAEL
		Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay
		Adams.
				MICHAEL
		My brother, Tom Hagen.
				MICHAEL
		Thanks Tom.
				MICHAEL
		My brother Sonny found him living
		in the streets when he was a kid,
		so my father took him in.  He's a
		good lawyer.
				MICHAEL
		Sure.
				MICHAEL
		He's my father's godson; he owes
		him his whole career.
				MICHAEL
		Tom said he'd take care of it.
				MICHAEL
		For bravery.
				MICHAEL
		For killing a man.
				MICHAEL
		I fought for my country.  It was my
		choice.
				MICHAEL
		I'm going to finish school.
				MICHAEL
		And what do you want for Christmas?
				MICHAEL
		As long as I tell him beforehand he
		won't object.  He'll be hurt, but
		he won't object.
				MICHAEL
		For dinner.  Unless I call and tell
		them we're still in New Hampshire.
				MICHAEL
		Then we can have dinner, see a
		show, and spend one more night.
				MICHAEL
		Shhh, you be the long distance
		operator.  Here.
				MICHAEL
		Hello, Tom?  Michael.  Yeah...
		listen, we haven't left yet.  I'm
		driving down to the city with Kay
		tomorrow morning.  There's something
		important I want to tell the old
		man before Christmas.  Will he be
		home tomorrow night?
				MICHAEL
		No.
				MICHAEL
		I'm thinking about it.
				MICHAEL
		No, I would not like you better if
		you were Ingrid Bergman.
				MICHAEL
			  (desperately)
		They don't say if he's dead or alive.
				MICHAEL
		Thanks.
				MICHAEL
			  (gently)
		You heard from Tom yet?
				MICHAEL
			  (taking her hand)
		C'mon.
				MICHAEL
		How's Mom?
				MICHAEL
		I can help you out...
				MICHAEL
		Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.
				MICHAEL
		What?
				MICHAEL
		Clemenza?  No, I don't believe it.
				MICHAEL
		How can you be sure?
				MICHAEL
		Is it going to be all-out war, like
		last time?
				MICHAEL
		Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop.
				MICHAEL
			  (softly)
		That's not how Pop would have
		played it.
				MICHAEL
			  (calmly)
		All right, Sonny.  All right.
				MICHAEL
		Is it like they say?  Is he that
		good?
				MICHAEL
		Hello.  Kay?
				MICHAEL
		He'll be OK.
				MICHAEL
		Yeah Kay, I'm here.
				MICHAEL
		Huh?
				MICHAEL
		I can't...
				MICHAEL
		Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
				MICHAEL
		To the city.
				MICHAEL
		I don't need them, Sonny.  I'm just
		going to see Pop in the hospital.
		Also, I got other things.
				MICHAEL
		Visiting hour ends at eight thirty.
		I'll just sit with him; I want to
		show respect.
				MICHAEL
		I don't think so.  You don't want
		to end up on page 3 of the Daily
		News.
				MICHAEL
		I don't think so either.
			  (silence)
		I better go.
				MICHAEL
		I want you to go back to New
		Hampshire...think things over.
				MICHAEL
		Goodbye.
				MICHAEL
		Hello?  Hello?
				MICHAEL
		I'm Michael Corleone--this is my
		father.  What happened to the
		detectives who were guarding him?
				MICHAEL
		You just stand here one minute...
				MICHAEL
		Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm
		down at the hospital.  I came down
		late.  There's no one here.  None
		of Tessio's people--no detectives,
		no one.  The old man is completely
		unprotected.
				MICHAEL
			  (furiously, but kept inside)
		I won't panic.
				MICHAEL
			  (coldly)
		You and I are going to move my
		father right now...to another room
		on another floor...Can you
		disconnect those tubes so we can
		wheel the bed out?
				MICHAEL
		You've read about my father in the
		papers.  You've seen that no one's
		here to guard him.  Now I've just
		gotten word that men are coming to
		this hospital to kill him.  Believe
		me and help me.
				MICHAEL
		Hurry, into there.
				MICHAEL
			  (stepping out)
		Who is it?
				MICHAEL
		Enzo, get out of here.  There's
		going to be trouble.
				MICHAEL
		Go outside; stand in front...I'll
		be out in a minute.
				MICHAEL
		Pop...Pop, it's me Michael.  Shhhh,
		don't try to speak.  There are men
		who are coming to try to kill you.
		But I'm with you...I'm with you
		now...
				MICHAEL
		Get rid of those and look like
		you've got a gun in your pocket.
				MICHAEL
		Listen...
				MICHAEL
			  (quietly)
		What happened to the detectives who
		were supposed to be guarding my
		father?
				MICHAEL
		I'll stay until you put guards
		around my father's room.
				MICHAEL
			  (deliberately, right
			  to McCLUSKEY's face,
			  as he's being handcuffed)
		How much is the Turk paying you to
		set my father up, Captain?
				MICHAEL
		Christ, Sonny really means business.
				MICHAEL
		Cut it out.
				MICHAEL
		We can't wait.  No matter what
		Sollozzo say about a deal, he's
		figuring out how to kill Pop.  You
		have to get Sollozzo now.
				MICHAEL
		Let's say now that we have to kill
		McCluskey.  We'll clear that up
		through our Newspaper contacts later.
				MICHAEL
		They want me to go to the conference
		with Sollozzo.  Set up the meeting
		for two days from now.  Sonny, get
		our informers to find out where the
		meeting will be held.
		Insist it has to be a public place:
		a bar or restaurant at the height
		of the dinner hour.  So I'll feel
		safe.  They'll check me when I meet
		them so I won't be able to carry a
		weapon; but Clemenza, figure out a
		way to have one planted there for
		me.
			  (pause)
		Then I'll kill them both.
				MICHAEL
			  (angrily, but cold)
		Sonny, it's all personal, and I
		learned it from him, the old man,
		the Godfather.  He took my joining
		the Marines personal.  I take
		Sollozzo trying to kill my father
		personal, and you know I'll kill
		them Sonny.
				MICHAEL
		How bad will it be?
				MICHAEL
		Why don't you stop living like a
		bum and get this place cleaned up.
				MICHAEL
		A million times.
				MICHAEL
		O.K.  How long do you think before
		I can come back?
				MICHAEL
		I want to settle things tonight.  I
		want my father left alone.
				MICHAEL
		We're going to New Jersey?
				MICHAEL
			  (using English for emphasis)
		Most important...I want a sure
		guarantee that no more attempts
		will be made on my father's life.
				MICHAEL
		Is it all right if I go to the
		bathroom?
				MICHAEL
		Now I can talk.  I feel much better.
				MICHAEL
		Don Tommassino.
				MICHAEL
		Calo and Fabrizzio are with me;
		nothing will happen.
				MICHAEL
		I know.
				MICHAEL
		Corleone.
				MICHAEL
		I was told that my Grandfather was
		murdered on its main street; and
		his murderers came to kill my
		father there when he was twelve
		years old.
				MICHAEL
		Don Tommassino...I should see this
		place.
				MICHAEL
		No...I would like to walk to
		Corleone.
				MICHAEL
		How do you know I come from America?
				MICHAEL
		Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.
				MICHAEL
		Yes.
				MICHAEL
			  (sternly)
		Shhhhh.
				MICHAEL
		What are you talking about?
				MICHAEL
		She wore a red dress, and a red
		ribbon in her hair.  She looks more
		Greek than Italian.  Do you know a
		beauty like that?
				MICHAEL
		Innkeeper.  More wine!
				MICHAEL
		Tell him to come to me.
				MICHAEL
			  (quietly)
		I understand I've offended you by
		talking about your daughter.  I
		offer you my apologies, I'm a
		stranger in this country, I don't
		know the customs very well.  Let me
		say this, I meant no disrespect to
		you or her...
				MICHAEL
		I am an American hiding in Sicily
		from the police of my country.  My
		name is Michael.  You can inform
		the police and make your fortune
		but then your daughter would lose a
		father rather than gain a husband.
		In any case, I want to meet your
		daughter.  With your permission and
		under the supervision of your
		family.  With all decorum.  With
		all respect.  I am an honorable man.
				MICHAEL
		When the proper time comes, I'll
		tell you everything that a wife's
		father should know.
				MICHAEL
		Your daughter's name?
				MICHAEL
		It's safer to teach you English.
				MICHAEL
		Ciao, Don Tommassino.
				MICHAEL
		Things went badly in Palermo?
				MICHAEL
		Is that why there are more men on
		the walls?
				MICHAEL
		What is it?
				MICHAEL
		Get the car.  I'll be leaving in
		ten minutes.  Where's Calo?
				MICHAEL
		No, she's going home to her family.
		She'll join me in a few weeks...
				MICHAEL
		No, I'll get it.  Where's Appolonia?
				MICHAEL
		Tell Fabrizzio and wait for me in
		the car.
				MICHAEL
			  (muttering to himself)
		Where the hell is he going?
				MICHAEL
		No.  No!
				MICHAEL
		Fabrizzio.  Let your shepherds know
		that the one who gives me Fabrizzio
		will own the finest pastures in
		Sicily.
				MICHAEL
			  (pained)
		No.
				MICHAEL
		I want children, I want a family.
		But I don't know when.
				MICHAEL
		I could accept everything that's
		happened; I could accept it, but
		that I never had a choice.  From
		the time I was born, you had laid
		this all out for me.
				MICHAEL
		You wanted me to be your son.
				MICHAEL
		Then why have I become a man like
		you?
				MICHAEL
		A man has to choose what he will be.
		I believe that.
				MICHAEL
		Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the
		airport?
				MICHAEL
		You look good, too.
				MICHAEL
			  (dryly)
		No.
				MICHAEL
		Come here a minute, Fredo.
				MICHAEL
		Who are those girls?
				MICHAEL
		Give them some money and send them
		home.
				MICHAEL
		Get rid of them...
				MICHAEL
		Johnny, the Corleone family is
		thinking of selling out all our
		interests in the Olive Oil business
		and settling here.  Moe Greene will
		sell us his interest so it can be
		wholly owned by friends of the
		family.
				MICHAEL
		I'll make him an offer he can't
		refuse.
				MICHAEL
		Johnny, the Don wants you to help
		us get started.  We figure
		entertainment will be the big
		factor in drawing gamblers.  We
		hope you'll sign a contract to
		appear five times a year for maybe
		a week long engagement.
		We hope your friends in the movies
		will do the same.  We count on you
		to convince them.
				MICHAEL
		Thanks.
				MICHAEL
		Is my credit good enough to buy you
		out?
				MICHAEL
		The hotel, the casino.  The Corleone
		family wants to buy you out.
				MICHAEL
		Your casino loses money.  Maybe we
		can do better.
				MICHAEL
			  (the worst insult)
		You're unlucky.
				MICHAEL
		You took Freddie in because the
		Corleone family bankrolled your
		casino.  You and the Corleone
		family are evened out.  This is for
		business; name your price.
				MICHAEL
			  (quietly, deadly)
		Is that why you thought you could
		slap Freddie around in public?
				MICHAEL
		You straightened my brother out?
				MICHAEL
		I have to go back to New York
		tomorrow.  Think of your price.
				MICHAEL
		The Don has semi-retired.  I'm
		running the Family business now.
		So anything you have to say, say it
		to me.
				MICHAEL
		Freddie, you're my older brother.
		I love you.  But don't ever take
		sides with anybody against the
		Family again.
				MICHAEL
		I have to see my father and his
		people when we get back to the Mall.
				MICHAEL
		We'll go to the show tomorrow
		night--we can change the tickets.
				MICHAEL
		No, you eat...don't wait up for me.
				MICHAEL
		Let HER ask.
				MICHAEL
		I'm busy.
				MICHAEL
		Let me think about it, O.K.?
				MICHAEL
		In six months you can break off
		from the Corleone Family and go on
		your own.  Carlo, I'm counting on
		you to make the move to Nevada;
		you'll be my right-hand man out
		there.  Tom Hagen is no longer the
		Consigliere.
				MICHAEL
		He's going to be our lawyer in
		Vegas.  Nobody goes to him with any
		other business as of now, this
		minute.  No reflection on Tom;
		that's the way I want it.  Besides,
		if I ever need any advice, who's a
		better Consigliere than my father.
				MICHAEL
		Maybe less...
				MICHAEL
		No.  I want things very calm for
		another six months.
				MICHAEL
		All I can say is that things are
		being resolved that are more
		effective than a thousand buttonmen
		on the streets.  Understood?
				MICHAEL
		I'll come to you when I need you.
				MICHAEL
		All right, then it's resolved.
				MICHAEL
		Tom, we're going to be legitimate
		all the way, and you're the legal
		man.  What could be more important
		than that.
				MICHAEL
		How did you find out?
				MICHAEL
		Not so perfectly if you noticed.
				MICHAEL
		You're not a wartime Consigliere.
		Things may get tough with the move
		we're trying.
				MICHAEL
			  (coldly)
		You're out, Tom.
				MICHAEL
		I'm going to talk to my father.
				MICHAEL
		I'll need him.
				MICHAEL
		How?
				MICHAEL
		Yes.
				MICHAEL
		I've always respected you...
				MICHAEL
		He talked to you?
				MICHAEL
			  (softly)
		Christ, Tom; I needed more time
		with him.  I really needed him.
				MICHAEL
		Not all...I needed another four
		months and I would have had them
		all.
			  (he looks at TOM)
		I guess you've figured it all out?
				MICHAEL
		I know now.
			  (a passion wells up
			  inside of MICHAEL)
		I'll make them call me Don.
				MICHAEL
			  (nods)
		A week from tonight.  In Brooklyn
		on Tessio's ground, where I'll be
		safe.
				MICHAEL
		But after the Baptism.  I've
		decided to stand as godfather to
		Connie's baby.
				MICHAEL
		Yes, I promise.
				MICHAEL
		I do renounce him.
				MICHAEL
		I do renounce them.
				MICHAEL
		I do wish to be baptized.
				MICHAEL
		Carlo...we've had a change in the
		plans.  Mama, Connie, Kay and the
		kids will have to take the trip out
		to Vegas without us.
				MICHAEL
		Go back to your house and wait for
		me...
				MICHAEL
			  (to KAY)
		I'll just be a couple of days...
				MICHAEL
		You have to answer for Santino.
				MICHAEL
		You fingered Sonny for the Barzini
		people.  That little farce you
		played out with my sister.  Did
		Barzini kid you that would fool a
		Corleone?
				MICHAEL
			  (quietly)
		Barzini is dead.  So is Philip
		Tattaglia, so are Strachi, Cuneo
		and Moe Greene...I want to square
		all the family accounts tonight.
		So don't tell me you're innocent;
		admit what you did.
				MICHAEL
			  (almost kindly)
		Don't be frightened.  Do you think
		I'd make my sister a widow?  Do you
		think I'd make your children
		fatherless?  After all, I'm
		Godfather to your son.  No, your
		punishment is that you're out of
		the family business.  I'm putting
		you on a plane to Vegas--and I want
		you to stay there.  I'll send
		Connie an allowance, that's all.
		But don't keep saying you're
		innocent; it insults my intelligence
		and makes me angry.  Who approached
		you, Tattaglia or Barzini?
				MICHAEL
			  (softly)
		Good, good.  Leave now; there's a
		car waiting to take you to the
		airport.
				MICHAEL
		I'll call your wife and tell her
		what flight you're on.
				MICHAEL
			  (smiles)
		Speak your mind.
				MICHAEL
		No.  This I have to do.
				MICHAEL
		Sit in the car.
				MICHAEL
		Where's the boss?
				MICHAEL
		Get her home and get a doctor.
				MICHAEL
		She's hysterical.
				MICHAEL
		Don't ask me.
				MICHAEL
		All right, this one time I'll let
		you ask about my affairs, one last
		time.
				MICHAEL
			  (after a very long pause)
		No.
