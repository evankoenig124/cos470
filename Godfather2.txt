				MICHAEL
		Let them speak for themselves.
				MICHAEL
		Francesca is my oldest brother's
		daughter.  He died many years ago,
		and ever since I've felt much more
		of a father than an uncle.  I love
		her very much.  I'm pleased and
		impressed that you had the thought
		to come to me before going on with
		your plans.  It shows me that
		you're a considerate man, and will
		be good to her.  What are you
		studying in college?
				MICHAEL
		How will Fine Arts support your new
		wife?
				MICHAEL
			(smiling)
		Never be embarrassed by your wealth.
		This recent contempt for money is
		still another trick of the rich to
		keep the poor without it.
			(warmly)
		Of course I give you my blessing.
		Let's set the wedding soon...it
		will be my pleasure to give the
		bride away.
				MICHAEL
			(continuing)
		...and take a few courses in
		Business Administration just to be
		on the safe side!
				MICHAEL
		Make her dowry impressive.  He
		comes from a family who still
		thinks an Italian bride goes
		barefoot.
				MICHAEL
		It's him.  Fabrizzio.
			(almost to himself)
		Revenge is a dish that tastes best
		when it's cold.
				MICHAEL
		Later.  Tom?
				MICHAEL
		Two-thirty.  That gives me time to
		see my boy.
				MICHAEL
		All right.  Apologize to Pentangeli.
				MICHAEL
		I said I would see my sister, alone.
				MICHAEL
		I saw him with you.
				MICHAEL
		Why do you come to me?  Why don't
		you go to a travel agent?
				MICHAEL
		The ink on your divorce isn't dry.
		Your children see you on weekends;
		your oldest boy, Michael Francis...
		was in some trouble with the Reno
		police over some petty theft that
		you don't even know about.
				MICHAEL
		You fly around the world with lazy
		young men who don't have any love
		for you, and use you like a whore.
				MICHAEL
		Then why do you come to me?
				MICHAEL
			(softly)
		Connie, I want to be reasonable
		with you.  You have a house here,
		with us.  You can live here with
		your kids...and you won't be
		deprived of anything.  I don't know
		much about Merle; I don't know what
		he does for a living; what he lives
		on.  Why don't you tell him marriage
		is really out of the question; and
		that you can't see him any more.
		He'll understand.  But if you
		disobey me, and marry this pimp...it
		would disappoint me.
				MICHAEL
		Are you finished?
				MICHAEL
		Then out.
				MICHAEL
		Rocco, his friends must be hungry.
		See what you can do, but I'd like
		to keep them away from the guests.
				MICHAEL
		You know my lawyer, Tom Hagen.
		Johnny Ola.
				MICHAEL
		Tom isn't going to sit in with us,
		Johnny.  He only handles specific
		areas of the family business.  Tom?
				MICHAEL
		Just tell Rocco I'm waiting.
				MICHAEL
		How is his health?
				MICHAEL
		Is there anything I can do; anything
		I can send?
				MICHAEL
		He's very kind, tell him it's
		appreciated.  I'm sure it will be
		profitable all the way around.
				MICHAEL
			(rising)
		This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr.
		John Ola of Miami.
				MICHAEL
		Mr. Ola's just leaving, Kay.
		Please tell the Senator I won't be
		a minute.
				MICHAEL
			(continuing)
		Kay.
				MICHAEL
		Find Hagen.
				MICHAEL
		It was very kind of you to come to
		my home on this occasion, Senator.
		My wife has been very concerned
		with making a good impression on
		the people who are our neighbors,
		and your appearance here has made
		her very happy.  If I can ever
		perform a service for you, you only
		have to ask.
				MICHAEL
		My lawyer, Tom Hagen.  He arranged
		this all through your man Turnbull.
				MICHAEL
		I trust these men with my life.
		They are my right arms; I cannot
		insult them by sending them away.
				MICHAEL
		Turnbull is a good man.
				MICHAEL
		Senator Geary, I speak to you as a
		businessman who has made a large
		investment in your state.  I have
		made that state my home; plan to
		raise my children here.  The
		license fee from the Gambling
		Commission costs one thousand
		dollars; why would I ever consider
		paying more?
				MICHAEL
			(quietly)
		We're all part of the same
		hypocrisy, Senator.  But never
		think it applies to my family.
				MICHAEL
		Senator...
			(cold and calm)
		...you can have my answer now if
		you'd like.
				MICHAEL
		My offer is this.  Nothing...not
		even the thousand dollars for the
		Gaming Commission, which I'd
		appreciate if you would put up
		personally.
				MICHAEL
		It's all right, Tom, we'll talk
		later.  Tell Frankie Pentangeli I'd
		like him to have dinner at my
		family table before we do business.
				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
		I know.
				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
		After dinner.
				MICHAEL
		We were all heartbroken at the
		news; but that wasn't cause to
		start a war.
				MICHAEL
		You were unfair with them.
				MICHAEL
		Clemenza promised Rosato three
		territories in the Bronx after he
		died, and then you took over and
		welched.
				MICHAEL
		They feel cheated.
				MICHAEL
			(suddenly in Sicilian)
		Your family still carries the name
		Corleone, and you will run it like
		a Corleone!
				MICHAEL
			(firm)
		Frankie, you're a good old man, and
		you've been loyal to my Father for
		years...so I hope you can explain
		what you mean.
				MICHAEL
		I know.  That's why I want you to
		be fair with them.
				MICHAEL
		No.  There are things that I have
		planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't
		want them disturbed.
				MICHAEL
		Frankie, you know my father
		respected Roth, did business with
		him.
				MICHAEL
		The old man had too much vino
		rosso, or he'd never talk openly
		that way.  Let him go back to New
		York; I've already made my plans.
			(he checks his watch)
		It's late; I've spent so little
		time at the party.
				MICHAEL
		Forget it, just go take care of her.
				MICHAEL
		How's the baby?
				MICHAEL
		Does it feel like a boy?
				MICHAEL
		I'm sorry about some of the people
		I had to see today.  It was bad
		timing... but it couldn't be helped.
				MICHAEL
		Can't you sleep?
				MICHAEL
		Are you alright?
				MICHAEL
		Did you like your party?
				MICHAEL
		Do you like them?
				MICHAEL
		They were friends.
				MICHAEL
		No, where is it?
				MICHAEL
		I'm leaving very early tomorrow,
		before you wake up.
				MICHAEL
		Just a few days.
				MICHAEL
		I can't.
				MICHAEL
		To do business.
				MICHAEL
		Some day you will.
				MICHAEL
		Go with the kids.
				MICHAEL
		Keep them alive.
				MICHAEL
		It's important.
				MICHAEL
		It will be all right.  We were lucky.
				MICHAEL
		And?
				MICHAEL
		Fredo, can't you shut that woman up!
			(to Rocco's men)
		Get her in here!
				MICHAEL
			(to Rocco)
		Have Tom Hagen meet me in the
		Harbor House.
				MICHAEL
		Sit down, Tom.
				MICHAEL
		There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom.
		I know that's upset you in the
		past; and you've felt that it was
		because of some lack of trust or
		confidence.  But it is because I do
		trust you that I've kept so much
		secret from you.  It's precisely
		that at this moment, you are the
		only one that I can completely
		trust.  In time, you'll understand
		everything.
				MICHAEL
		No, I have confidence in their
		loyalty... but this is life and
		death, and Tom, you are my brother.
				MICHAEL
		No Tom, just listen.  All my people
		are businessmen; their loyalty is
		based on that.  One thing I learned
		from my father is to try to think
		as the people around you think...and
		on that basis, anything is possible.
		Fredo has a good heart, but he is
		weak...and stupid, and stupid
		people are the most dangerous of
		all.  I've kept you out of things,
		Tom, because I've always known that
		your instincts were legitimate, and
		I wanted you to know very little of
		things that would make you an
		accomplice, for your own protection.
		I never blamed you for the setbacks
		the family took under Sonny; I know
		you were in a position of limited
		power, and you did your best to
		advise and caution him.  What I am
		saying is that now, for how long I
		do not know, you will be the Don.
		If what I think has happened is
		true; I will leave tonight, and
		absolutely no one will know how to
		contact me.  And even you are not
		to try to reach me unless it is
		absolutely necessary.  I give you
		complete power: over Neri... Fredo,
		everyone.  I am trusting you with
		the lives of my wife and children,
		and the future of this family,
		solely resting on your judgment and
		talent.
				MICHAEL
			(continuing)
		...But Tom, you must know that I do
		this only because I believe you are
		the only one who is capable of
		taking over for me.
				MICHAEL
		I've prepared this; have had it for
		over a month.  It won't explain
		everything; but indicates where I
		will be, so in a sense, it is my
		life.
			(he hands the envelope
			to Hagen)
		Also, there are three tasks that
		must be executed immediately.  Pop
		would have given those to Luca --
		You knew Pop as well as anyone, act
		as though you were him.  It
		discusses Kay as well; that will be
		the most difficult.  The men who
		tried to kill me tonight, will
		never leave the estate.
				MICHAEL
		I don't think so.  Unless I'm very
		wrong...they're already dead.
		Killed by someone inside...very
		frightened that they botched it.
		That's why I am going to disappear
		in a few minutes, and leave
		everything to you.
				MICHAEL
		If I'm wrong...
				MICHAEL
		...I don't think I'm wrong.
			(he indicates the knock)
		Yes.
				MICHAEL
		Yes.
				MICHAEL
		Put it right there.
				MICHAEL
		Thank you.
				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
			 (to Bussetta)
		You'll wait in the car.
				MICHAEL
		Thank you, Mrs. Roth.
				MICHAEL
		Fine.
				MICHAEL
		Not for a few years.
				MICHAEL
		Yes.
				MICHAEL
		The incident of the other night is
		a nuisance that I can take care of.
		I came to you because I want
		nothing to affect our agreement; I
		wanted to clear everything I'm
		going to do with you, just in case.
				MICHAEL
		You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I
		have much to learn from you.
				MICHAEL
		The Rosato Brothers have performed
		services for you in the past; I
		understand that they are under your
		protection.
				MICHAEL
		Technically, they are still under
		the Clemenza wing of the Corleone
		Family, now run by Frankie
		Pentangeli.  After Clemenza died,
		the Rosatos wanted territory of
		their own.  Pentangeli refused, and
		came to me, asking for permission
		to eliminate them.  I, of course,
		knew of their relationship with
		you, and in gratitude for your help
		with the Tropicana matter, turned
		him down.  Pentangeli was furious,
		and paid one hundred and fifty
		thousand dollars to have me killed.
		I was lucky and he was stupid.
		I'll visit him soon.
			(leaning toward the
			old man, sincerely)
		The important thing is that nothing
		jeopardize our plans, yours and
		mine.  This thing of ours, that we
		will build.
				MICHAEL
			(quietly)
		Pentangeli is a dead man; do you
		object?
				MICHAEL
		Then it's done.  I must choose his
		replacement: it cannot be Rosato.
				MICHAEL
		I didn't want you to know I was
		coming.  You heard what happened in
		my home?
				MICHAEL
			(furious)
		In my home!  In the same room where
		my wife was sleeping; where my
		children come in their pajamas, and
		play with their toys.
				MICHAEL
		I want you to help me take my
		revenge.
				MICHAEL
		I want you to settle these troubles
		with the Rosato Brothers.
				MICHAEL
		I want you to settle on their terms.
				MICHAEL
		Trust me; do as I ask.
				MICHAEL
		Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I
		have your loyalty?
				MICHAEL
		I know.
				MICHAEL
			(coldly, but convincing)
		Frankie, Roth tried to have me
		killed.  I'm sure it was him, but I
		don't know yet why.
				MICHAEL
		This was my father's old study.
		When I was a kid, we had to be
		quiet when we played near here.
		When I was older, I learned many
		things from him here.  I was happy
		that this house never went to
		strangers; first Clemenza took it
		over, and then you.  My father
		taught me, in this room, never to
		act until you know everything
		that's behind things.  Never.  If
		Hyman Roth sees that I interceded
		with you in the Rosato Brothers'
		favor, he'll think his relationship
		with me is still sound.  I'm going
		somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We
		have friends in some very important
		business that we're making.  Do
		this for me; you make the peace
		with the Rosato Brothers on their
		terms.  Let the word out that I
		forced you; you're not happy wit
		hit, but acquiesced, just because
		of me.  It will get back to Hyman
		Roth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can
		trust me.
				MICHAEL
		Good.
				MICHAEL
		No, I'm fine.
				MICHAEL
		Very impressive.
				MICHAEL
		I was told the Cubans now call this
		drink: "La Mentira."
				MICHAEL
		It means... "The Lie."
				MICHAEL
		I saw an interesting thing today.
		A man was being arrested by the
		Military Police; probably an urban
		guerrilla.  Rather than be taken
		alive, he exploded a grenade hidden
		in his jacket, taking the command
		vehicle with him.
				MICHAEL
		It occurred to me: the police are
		paid to fight, and the Rebels are
		not.
				MICHAEL
		So, that occurred to me.
				MICHAEL
		We're making a big investment in
		Cuba.  That's my only concern.
				MICHAEL
		The money was sent.
				MICHAEL
		I wouldn't consider anyone else.
				MICHAEL
		You'll be there to see it; you'll
		be there.
				MICHAEL
		Thank you.
			(click, click)
		Tom?  Tom, is that you?
				MICHAEL
		Mio fratello.
				MICHAEL
		It's all right.  He stays with me
		all the time.
				MICHAEL
		We're making an investment in Havana.
				MICHAEL
		Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.
				MICHAEL
		Pentangeli's dead.  He was ambushed
		by the Rosato Brothers.
			(pause)
		Didn't you know that?
				MICHAEL
		I want you to help me, Fredo.
				MICHAEL
		Tonight I want to relax with you.
		The Senator from Nevada is here
		with some people from Washington.
		I want to show them a good time in
		Havana.
				MICHAEL
		I'd like to come along.  There's
		been a lot of strain, and I've been
		cooped up in this room for three
		days.
				MICHAEL
		This doubles my investment.
				MICHAEL
		Six million dollars in cash is a
		high price for a piece of a country
		in the middle of a revolution.
				MICHAEL
		I've read it; I'm pleased that the
		government is doing so well.  As a
		heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How
		did the doctor find you?
				MICHAEL
		Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
				MICHAEL
		I know that; but who gave the go
		ahead.
				MICHAEL
		I know it wasn't me...so that
		leaves you.
				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
		How sick do you think the old man is?
				MICHAEL
		I never looked down on you, Fredo.
		You don't look down at a brother.
				MICHAEL
		Let him gamble.
				MICHAEL
		No.
				MICHAEL
		It was hard to have him killed.
				MICHAEL
		It was hard to have him killed.
				MICHAEL
		It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
				MICHAEL
		You know otherwise, Freddie?
				MICHAEL
		How is your wife, Fredo...your
		marriage?
				MICHAEL
		"Yo soy un hombre sincero..."
		I am a sincere man,
		From the land of the palms...
				MICHAEL
		The song.  Are you sincere with me,
		Fredo?
				MICHAEL
		Then I'm going to confide in you;
		trust you with something.
				MICHAEL
		Tonight we've been invited to a
		reception at the Presidential
		Palace; to bring in the New Year.
		You and I will go in a special car
		that's being sent.  They'll have
		cocktails... then dinner, and a
		reception with the President.  When
		it's over, it will be suggested
		that you take Questadt and his
		friends from Washington to spend
		the night with some women.  I'll go
		home alone in the car; and before I
		reach the hotel, I'll be
		assassinated.
				MICHAEL
		The same man who tried in Nevada...
		Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.
				MICHAEL
		It was never Pentangeli... I've
		always known that.  It was Roth all
		along.  He talks to me as a son; as
		his successor, but the old man
		thinks he'll live forever.
				MICHAEL
		To go tonight, with me, as though
		we know nothing.  I've already made
		my move.
				MICHAEL
		The old man will never bring in the
		New Year.
				MICHAEL
		Fredo.  Where are you going?
				MICHAEL
		I've arranged for a plane; we're
		going to Miami in an hour.  Try not
		to make a big thing of it.
				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
		I know it was you, Fredo.  You've
		broken my heart.
				MICHAEL
		Come with me.  It's your only way
		of getting out!
				MICHAEL
		He isn't here.
				MICHAEL
		All right.  Go now.
				MICHAEL
		Do you think they have somebody to
		back up Cicci?
				MICHAEL
		Al, get me a wet towel.  Does Kay
		know I'm back?
				MICHAEL
		Did the boy get something from me
		for Christmas?
				MICHAEL
		What was it, so I'll know.
				MICHAEL
		Fellas, can you wait outside a
		minute?
				MICHAEL
		Where's my brother?
				MICHAEL
		I asked about Fredo?
				MICHAEL
		I want you to reach Fredo.  I know
		he's scared, but have one of our
		people reach him.  Assure him that
		there will be no reprisals.  Tell
		him that I know Roth misled him.
				MICHAEL
			(indicating Rocco and
			Neri on the balcony)
		They can come in now.
				MICHAEL
		Alright.
				MICHAEL
			(impatiently)
		Go on, tell me.
				MICHAEL
		Was it a boy or a girl?
				MICHAEL
		What is it, can't you give me
		straight answers anymore!
				MICHAEL
		And Kay...she's all right?
				MICHAEL
		Does she blame it on me?  The baby?
				MICHAEL
		Mom... Mom...
				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
		It's Michael.  How are you, Mom?
				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
		There are still things I have to do.
				MICHAEL
		Alright.  They bother me once in
		awhile.
			(a pause as he thinks)
		Tell me, when Pop had troubles...
		did he ever think, even to himself,
		that he had gone the wrong way;
		that maybe by trying to be strong
		and trying to protect his family,
		that he could... that he could...
		lose it instead?
				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
		No, I meant lose his family.
				MICHAEL
			(almost to himself)
		But times are different...
				MICHAEL
		Yes.
				MICHAEL
		It was not an alias.  GODFATHER was
		a term of affection, used by his
		friends, one of respect.
				MICHAEL
		No.
				MICHAEL
		I deny his every charge.
				MICHAEL
		That is a complete falsehood.
				MICHAEL
		That is not true.  I own some stock
		in some of the hotels, but only
		very small amounts.  I also own
		some American Telephone and IBM
		stock.
				MICHAEL
		Senator, I've observed the head of
		General Motors before a Senate
		Committee, and his lawyer whispered
		in his ear.  That was not commented
		upon in the way you have just done.
				MICHAEL
		I do not.
				MICHAEL
		I do not.
				MICHAEL
			(reading)
		In the hopes of clearing my family
		name, in the sincere desire to give
		my children their fair share of the
		American way of life without a
		blemish on their name and background
		I have appeared before this
		committee and given it all the
		cooperation in my power.  I consider
		my being called before this
		committee an act of prejudice to
		all Americans of Italian extraction.
		I consider it a great dishonor to
		me personally to have to deny that
		I am a criminal.  I wish to have
		the following noted for the record.
		That I served my country faithfully
		and honorably in World War II and
		was awarded the Distinguished
		Service Cross for actions in
		defense of my country.  That I have
		never been arrested or indicted for
		any crime whatsoever... that no
		proof linking me to any criminal
		conspiracy, whether it is called
		Mafia or Cosa Nostra or whatever
		other name you wish to give, has
		ever been made public.  Only one
		man has made charges against me,
		and that man is known to be a
		murderer, arsonist and rapist.  And
		yet this committee had used this
		person to besmirch my name.  My
		personal protest can only be made
		to the people of this country.  I
		can only thank God that in this
		country we have a legal system and
		courts of law to protect innocent
		people from wild accusation.  I
		thank God for our democratic due
		process of Law that shields me from
		the false charges made by this
		committee's witness.  I have not
		taken refuge behind the Fifth
		Amendment, though counsel advised
		me to do so.  I challenge this
		committee to produce any witness or
		evidence against me, and if they do
		not, I hope they will have the
		decency to clear my name with the
		same publicity with which they have
		now besmirched it.  I ask this
		without malice, in the interests of
		fair play.
				MICHAEL
		How did they get their hands on
		Pentangeli?
				MICHAEL
		What does Fredo know?
				MICHAEL
		Alright.  I'm going to go outside
		and talk to Fredo.
				MICHAEL
		We have time.
				MICHAEL
		What about now, is there anything
		you can help me out with?
				MICHAEL
		And you believed that story.
				MICHAEL
		I've always taken care of you.
				MICHAEL
		It's the way Pop wanted it.
				MICHAEL
		There's nothing more you can tell
		me about this investigation?
				MICHAEL
		You're nothing to me now, Fredo;
		not a brother, not a friend, I
		don't want to know you, or what
		happens to you.  I don't want to
		see you at the hotels, or near my
		home.  When you visit our Mother, I
		want to know a day in advance, so I
		won't be there.  Do you understand?
				MICHAEL
		I don't want anything to happen to
		him while my Mother's alive.
				MICHAEL
		On the phone?
				MICHAEL
		I had no idea...
				MICHAEL
		Where?
				MICHAEL
		Why don't you sit down?
				MICHAEL
		There are a lot of things I want to
		talk to you about.  Things I've
		been thinking about -- changes I
		want to make.
				MICHAEL
		Why too late?
				MICHAEL
		His brother came to help him.
				MICHAEL
		On a plane back to Sicily.
				MICHAEL
		That's all.  You see, in Sicily, in
		the old days... there was only one
		legitimate reason to kill a blood
		relative... only one.  IF he was a
		traitor.
				MICHAEL
		Kay, you've got it wrong.  That
		kind of thing's all over, I promised
		you.  This was between the two
		brothers.  Years ago Frankie had a
		young girlfriend; he called her his
		co-wife.  That was his joke, but he
		meant it.  He wouldn't divorce his
		wife... because she was a great
		cook.  He said he girlfriend made a
		spaghetti sauce once and it was so
		terrible he knew he could never
		marry her.  He set her up in a
		house in Jersey.  She had to be
		faithful... and she had to have kids.
		And she did, two, a boy and a girl.
		He had her checked out and watched
		so she couldn't cheat... but the
		girl couldn't stand that kind of
		life.  She begged him to let her go.
		He did.  He gave her money and made
		her give up the kids.  Then Frankie
		took them to Italy, and had them
		brought up by his brother Vincenzo.
		Where he knew they'd by safe.
				MICHAEL
		When he saw his brother in the
		hearing room, he knew what was at
		stake.
			(pause)
		I don't think Vincenzo would have
		done it.  He loves the kids, too.
		Omerta, Kay.  Honor, silence.  It
		had nothing to do with me.  It was
		between those brothers.
				MICHAEL
		Kay, I told you...
				MICHAEL
		I won't let you leave!  Christ, do
		you think I'm going to let you leave.
				MICHAEL
		No, I don't want to hear anything.
		There are things between men and
		women that will not change; things
		that have been the same for
		thousands of years.  You are my
		wife, and they are my children...
		and I love you and I will not let
		you leave, because you are MINE!
				MICHAEL
		If that's what it takes; then yes,
		I will.
				MICHAEL
		We'll go back tonight.  Bring the
		children.
				MICHAEL
		How can I let you leave; how can I
		let you take my children away?
		Don't you know me?  You understand,
		it's an impossibility.  I would
		never let it happen; no, never, not
		if it took all my strength, all my
		cunning.  But in time, soon, you'll
		feel differently.  You see, you'll
		be happy that I stopped you.  I
		know you.  You'll forget about
		this; you'll forget about the baby
		we lost... and we'll go on, you and
		I.
				MICHAEL
		I know what it meant... and I'm
		prepared to make it up to you.  I
		will make changes; I can.
			(he clenches his fist tightly)
		I CAN change; that I have learned,
		that I have the strength to change...
		And we have another child, a boy...
		and you'll forget the miscarriage.

			(coldly)
		You won't take my children.
				MICHAEL
		No.
				MICHAEL
		Tom is right.
				MICHAEL
		The children can stay.
				MICHAEL
			(without looking back)
		Sit down, Tom.  Have you heard
		about our friend and partner, Mr.
		Hyman Roth?
				MICHAEL
		They won't take him; not for a
		million, not for ten million.
				MICHAEL
		He's been dying of the same heart
		attack for twenty years.
				MICHAEL
		I want it met.
				MICHAEL
		I don't like it when you use the
		word impossible; nothing is
		impossible...
				MICHAEL
		I'm surprised at you, Tom.  If
		there's anything certain; certain
		in life; if history has taught us
		anything, it's that you can kill...
			(he stops, then coldly)
		ANYBODY.  But perhaps your
		relucatance is because you've come
		to tell me that you're moving your
		family to Vegas, that you've been
		offered the Vice-Presidency of the
		Houstan Hotels there.  Or weren't
		you going to tell me at all?
				MICHAEL
		They are everywhere!
				MICHAEL
		I know you do, Tom.  Then I can
		count on you to help me do the
		things I have to do.  If not, call
		Houstan, and become a Vice-President.
		Take your family and your mistress
		and move them to Las Vegas.
				MICHAEL
		Good.  Then you're staying.
				MICHAEL
		Anthony.
				MICHAEL
		You've grown so tall... so tall in
		the last year.  You're much taller
		than me.
				MICHAEL
		Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I
		waited for you to have some lunch,
		but now it's all dried out.
				MICHAEL
		Well, that's alright... alright.
		Good.  You'll graduate in another
		year, isn't that right?  You know...
		I never finished college.  I was a
		good student, but I never finished.
		Of course, there was a war then.
				MICHAEL
		Hurry back; we'll talk.  We'll talk.
				MICHAEL
		Pop, I've decided I'm going to
		enlist.
				MICHAEL
		I never asked for it; I don't want
		it.
				MICHAEL
		No, Dad.
				MICHAEL
		It's not talk; I'm doing it.
				MICHAEL
		Not for strangers; for my country.
				MICHAEL
		That's how it was in the old world,
		Pop, but this is not Sicily.
				MICHAEL
		I won't be a man like you.
